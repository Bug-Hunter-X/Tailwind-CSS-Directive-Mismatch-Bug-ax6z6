# Tailwind CSS Directive Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Tailwind CSS: using directives (classes) or plugins that aren't correctly configured.

## Bug Description
The core issue arises from a discrepancy between the Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) and the actual CSS classes used in your components. This might involve:

* **Using undefined classes:**  Attempting to use a class that hasn't been specified or generated by Tailwind.
* **Incorrect plugin configuration:** Plugins may require specific setup in `tailwind.config.js` to function correctly. Missing or wrong configurations can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Reproduction
The `bug.js` file illustrates code that uses an undefined Tailwind class.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code, ensuring the class is defined or the plugin is correctly set up.
